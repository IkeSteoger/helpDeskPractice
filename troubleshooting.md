# Troubleshooting

## Technical Knowledge and Skills

### Can you explain the steps you would take to troubleshoot a computer that won’t boot?

- Double check power source / try a new power source
- If tower is receiving power, check monitor connections
- Disconnect USB devices & try to boot
- Remove new hardware installed / Check it is installed correctly
- Listen for a POST beep (install a internal speaker if none installed)
- Use System Restore or Startup Repair
- Escalate via ticketing system if unable to solve

### How do you handle a situation where a user is unable to connect to the company’s VPN?

- Check Internet Connection
- Check your VPN credentials
- Restart any VPN software
- Check your VPN settings
- Clear old VPN software from device
- Reinstall / Update VPN software
- Reboot the router
- Try different VPN protocols/ports
- Escalate via ticketing system if unable to solve

### Describe the process of setting up a new user in a Windows environment

- Start > Settings > Accounts > Other Users > Add someone else to this PC

### What steps would you take to resolve a slow performance issue on a user’s computer?

- Check running tasks in Task Manager
- If Task Manager shows the issue - solve it either via ending the processes or uninstalling the problem application / adding more RAM / etc
- Restart PC
- Check disk space / free up disk space
- Update OS and Software
- Run a hardware diagnostic test
- Escalate via ticketing system if unable to solve

### How do you approach diagnosing a network connectivity problem?

- Figure out the exact problem being had (slow connection? no connection at all? connected locally but not to the internet?)
- Check all physical connections
- Restart computer / modem / router
- Run network diagnostics
- Disable firewalls / antivirus
- Test connection with a different device
- Escalate via ticketing system if unable to solve

## Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills

### Can you describe a time when you had to troubleshoot a particularly difficult technical issue? How did you resolve it?

- I often have to resolve difficult problems while independent broadcasting, one specific issue I remember having was constant dropped frames due to rendering & encoding lag. I tried a few solutions off the top of my mind that might work - dropping from 1080p to 720p for example worked well. But I didn't want to sacrifice quality! So I did more research with Google-fu and tested some more options presented by others having similar issues. Turned out - my CPU was too weak for the rendering / encoding I was trying to do! One great way to solve this was to upgrade to a 2000 series NVidia GPU - which gave me the option of NVENC encoding to off-load tons of the work onto my graphics card.

### If a user reports that their email client is not receiving emails, what steps would you take to resolve the issue?

- Double check they are connected to the internet
- Double check emails aren't going to spam
- Verify username & passwords are correct
- Check SMTP server details / change SMTP port
- Make sure firewalls & anti-virus aren't causing a conflict
- Send a test email and see if we receive a non-delivery report message
- Escalate via ticketing system if unable to solve

### How do you prioritize multiple IT support requests when they come in at the same time?

- I would quickly skim over each support request and see which one is causing barriers to peoples' immediate needs. After identifying which ones are causing barriers - I would pick the easiest fixes first so that those people could continue past their barrier. After which I would move on to the more difficult tickets and apologize for the wait.

## Customer Service and Communication

### Describe a situation where you had to explain a technical issue to a non-technical user. How did you ensure they understood?

- I often find myself having to explain independent broadcasting software to other aspiring broadcasters. This gives me a great chance to use non-techincal wording for a fairly technical software, and finding way to use non-technical words for tech jargon can actually be a fun challenge! It also helps me understand it better myself. One way I make sure they understood is asking them to repeat back what I explained to them in their own words & leave notes for them on any confusing parts.

### How would you handle a situation where a user is frustrated and upset about a recurring technical problem?

- First off, apologize! No one likes tech issues, and repeated ones can be annoying. I would also mention this is just the nature of computers sometimes - its not the user's fault! Afterwards, I would try to set them up in the best way possible for this technical problem to happen again - and if possible get them setup with an upgrade to completely solve it!
